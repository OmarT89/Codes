In this video we show you how to do a Home Assistant Supervised Installation

Personally I prefer to run this in a VM because you can take a snapshot prior to upgrades and rollback if things go thing wrong

Also, if you run this on say a Raspberry Pi for instance and that stops working, you're home automatation will be out of service while you source a replacement computer and then restore Home Assistant

With a VM though, you can run it on another hypervisor until you can replace the broken computer

Although you can download and install Home Assistant as a pre-built VM, another option is to do a supervised installation

This involves instaling Home Assistant onto a Debian OS which brings the extra benefit of being able take advantage of features in Linux such as USB over IP for instance

Assumptions:  
It is assumed that you already have a hypervisor to run this on, but Proxmox VE is recommended  
As even the FBI warn, security is something you need to take seriously with smart home devices  
While you can use a software firewall like UFW on a Debian computer, Proxmox VE also provides a firewall option  
The benefit of using the firewall in Proxmox VE is that's independent of the VM, meaning only a Proxmox administrator can make changes to it  
It also avoids some of the complications of the extra rules required to support Docker for instance

Steps Taken
1) Debian OS  
Debian OS is supported so you need to create a VM with Debian installed  
This should either have a static IP address or a reserved IP address in DHCP  
By default, there is no support for sudo so switch to root  
su -  
And make sure the OS is up to date  
apt update && apt upgrade -y  

2) Install Dependencies  
apt install apparmor jq wget curl udisks2 libglib2.0-bin network-manager dbus systemd-journal-remote -y  

3) Install Docker-CE  
The Docker Community Edition is supported so install this  
curl -fsSL get.docker.com | sh  

4) Install HA OS Agent  
The OS agent for HA needs to be installed to allow communication with the OS  
TIP: Check for the latest version  
https://github.com/home-assistant/os-...  

Download and install the package  
wget https://github.com/home-assistant/os-...  
dpkg -i os-agent_1.4.1_linux_x86_64.deb  
TIP: Copy the URL in the web browser

4) Install HA Supervised 
Download the package
wget https://github.com/home-assistant/sup... -O homeassistant-supervised.deb  
The -O parameter is to overwrite the existing file

Install the package
dpkg -i homeassistant-supervised.deb  
Now reboot the computer

5) Onboarding
With the installation complete and the computer back up and running, point your web browser to port 8123 of the computer  
E.g. http://192.168.100.20:8213  
NOTE: At this stage, HTTPS is not available
Wait for the HA wizard to become available and then follow the process

6) Updating Home Assistant  
Home Assistant Code, Add-Ons and Integrations can be updated as normal
Other software will need to be updated from the CLI
That can be done by repeating the installation process, although OS-Agent will need a newer file downloading

7) Troubleshooting
For problems check the logs in HA or check the operating system logs  
journalctl -f
